            <h1 class="introduction">My long weekend in Colorado: An itinerary</h1>
            <p class = "introduction">On October 11th, the day this assignment is due, I'm leaving 
                work early and hightailing it to Denver, CO. I haven't been to the Rocky Mountains 
                since I was a kid. More than anything else about that trip, I remember the nosebleeds.
                <br><br>It's high time to go back and make some new memories. To help me with the planning process 
                (and knock some homework out at the same time) I'm making this website.<br><br>
                Below, you'll find my trip itinerary.

                        <p class="content">Thursday is a driving day. It takes eight
                            and a half hours to get to Denver if you're going 5 over Kansas' 80mph speed 
                            limit. <br><br>
                            I'm planning on spending the time with my favorite podcasts: <a href="https://genwhypod.com/">Gen Why</a>, <a href="https://upandvanished.com/">Up and Vanished</a>,
                            and <a href="https://blog.codepen.io/radio/">CodePen Radio</a>.<br><br>
                            <em>Up and Vanished</em> is sure to be especially atmospheric: it investigates the disappearance
                            of a young woman in Crestone, CO aka "The Tibet of North America." Kristal Reisinger was 
                            29 when she disappeared. She had recently moved to Crestone in search of 
                            good vibrations, synergy, enlightenment.<br><br>
                            Kristal's story is especially jarring given its setting. The Rockies are so beautiful, the 
                            wooded hush so powerful, it doesn't seem like someone should meet a horrible end there.
                            I'm hooked hopelessly.

                            I'll miss their very own First Friday by a week (bummer) but I'm still in close proximity to 
                            all sorts of breweries, coffee shops, and -- importantly -- highways.
                            <br><br>Why would I want to be near highways? Because I plan on spending my first 
                            day in Colorado mountain biking.
                            <br><br>First thing Friday morning I'm packing my bike, some peanut butter 'n banana sandwiches,
                            and about 5 liters of water and I'm headed 45 minutes southwest of town to a trail system called <a href="https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/845269/buffalo-creek-big-loop-imba-epic">The Buffalo Creek Big Loop</a>.
                            <br><br>Those 25 miles of intermediate trails have my name written all over them.

                             had some second thoughts.

                             plotting my route, and going to granny creep it over the mountains and through the woods.
